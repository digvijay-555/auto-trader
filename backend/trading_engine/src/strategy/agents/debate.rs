//! Bull-vs-bear debate and consensus scoring.
//!
//! Each analyst's view is assigned to the bull or the bear side and scored as
//! `weight × confidence`. Both sides are then normalised against the *total*
//! weight in the room — including agents that abstained — so an abstention
//! genuinely dilutes conviction rather than being silently excluded from the
//! denominator. Two agents agreeing while three abstain is not a 100% consensus.
//!
//! A trade requires **both**:
//!
//! - the winning side's score to clear [`StrategyConfig::conviction_threshold`], and
//! - the winner to beat the loser by at least [`StrategyConfig::min_debate_margin`].
//!
//! The margin requirement guards against a split decision — a market the agents
//! genuinely disagree about, where taking a directional long-premium position is
//! how a strategy pays theta to be wrong slowly.
//!
//! # Why the margin check looks redundant at the default threshold
//!
//! Because every agent contributes to at most one side and both sides share the
//! same denominator, `bull_score + bear_score ≤ 100`. So a winner scoring 75
//! forces the loser to 25 or below, and the margin is already ≥ 50 — the margin
//! test cannot fail while `conviction_threshold` is 75.
//!
//! It is kept deliberately. The threshold is operator-tunable, and the margin
//! check is what stops a lowered threshold (say 40) from letting a 45-vs-40
//! near-tie trade. It is a guard against a future configuration, not dead code
//! under the current one.
